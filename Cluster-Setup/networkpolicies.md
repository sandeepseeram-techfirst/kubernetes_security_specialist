# Network Policies 

1. Kubernetes assigns a unique IP address to every Pod upon creation from the Pod CIDR range of its node. 

2. The IP address is ephemeral and therefore cannot be considered stable over time. 

3. Every restart of a Pod leases a new IP address. 

4. Itâ€™s recommended to use Pod-to-Service communication over Pod-to-Pod communication so that you can rely on a consistent network interface.


##### Network policies act similarly to firewall rules, but for Pod-to-Pod communication. Rules can include the direction of network traffic (ingress and/or egress) for one or many Pods within a namespace or across different namespaces, as well as their targeted ports.
