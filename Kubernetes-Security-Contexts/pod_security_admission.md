# Pod Security Admission 

Older versions of Kubernetes shipped with a feature called Pod Security Policies (PSP). Pod Security Policies are a concept that help with enforcing security standards for Pod objects. 

Kubernetes 1.21 deprecated Pod Security Policies and introduced the replacement functionality Pod Security Admission. 


Kubernetes release 1.25 completely removed Pod Security Policies.
